          title: You successfully booked your Certificate

In case of a violation, we cannot issue a Certificate. Always remember:"
          exclusion_criteria:
            <ul><li>You need to be the <strong>only person</strong> in front of the camera. If no person, multiple people, or another person than the registered one is visible, proctoring will fail.</li>
            <li>Choose an exam period where you are <strong>undisturbed</strong> and do not have to leave your place during the exam.</li>
            <li>Ensure <strong>adequate light conditions</strong> and that your face is clearly visible. A source of light in the back can make your face appear too dark in the camera.</li>
            <li>Don't use anything that covers your head or face (hat, sunglasses, ...). Reading glasses are allowed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Technical advice:</p>
            <ul><li>Make sure your camera is turned on and fully functional. Remove your webcam cover.</li>
            <li>Close all other applications that access the camera.</li>
            <li>During the exam, make sure the assignment tab is the only open tab in your browser.</li></ul>
        deadline_passed: The registration period for the Certificate has passed. You can still earn a Record of Achievement by completing the graded quizzes.
        upgrade_not_possible: You already have submitted too many weekly assignments and therefore can no more book the Certificate. You can still earn a Record of Achievement by completing the graded quizzes.
        upgrade_information:
          title: Do you want to book a Certificate?
          info: You can still register for the Certificate until <strong>%{deadline}</strong>. The Certificate is a paid add-on. You can always earn a free Record of Achievement by completing the graded quizzes.
          registration_periods_info: <b>Registration Periods:</b> You can register for the Certificate only before the submission deadline of the second graded assignment. If the deadline for submitting the second assignment has expired, an application for the proctored examination is no longer possible.

      general: "Peer assessment enables learners to assess their peers’ work. This allows instructors to design assignments that need human evaluation, even in massive open online courses.

      "Xikolo::PeerAssessment::AssignmentSubmission": "<strong>Submit your work:</strong> during this phase, you submit your work. Make sure that you adhere to the submission deadline, otherwise your work cannot be graded and you will not earn any points."
      "Xikolo::PeerAssessment::Training": "<strong>Learn to grade:</strong> during this phase, you evaluate some expert-graded submissions. You can compare your grading with the instructor grading and are able to adjust/ review your grading."
      "Xikolo::PeerAssessment::PeerGrading": "<strong>Evaluate your peers:</strong> you assess randomly assigned submissions of your peers (usually 3 to 5). Grading is done anonymously and is based on criteria provided by the instructor. Participation in the assessment stage is required if you want your own submission to be assessed and considered for points. Make sure to adhere to the deadline, otherwise your assessment will not be considered."
      "Xikolo::PeerAssessment::SelfAssessment": "<strong>Evaluate yourself:</strong> during this phase, you evaluate your own work after you have seen the submission of your peers. If your self-evaluation score is within 10% of your overall peer grade, you'll receive bonus points. As always, make sure that you adhere to the deadline."

          - Each peer assessment always includes the phases “Submit your work”, “Evaluate your peers”, and “View your results”.
          - The phases “Learn to grade” and “Evaluate yourself” are not essential and can be left out. If you include these phases, you can mark them as “optional”. Optional phases can be skipped by the participants.
          - If you include a “Learn to grade” phase, the course team must evaluate 10 submissions that serve participants as training examples. The “Learn to grade” phase can only start after these 10 training submissions have been evaluated.
          - The unlock date of each phase determines when participants can start the phase. If no unlock date has been specified, participants can start the phase as soon as they have completed the previous phase.
          - The deadline is a mandatory field. It specifies by when participants have to complete the phase.
