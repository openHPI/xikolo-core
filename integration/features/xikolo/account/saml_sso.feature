  Scenario: Register a new account via SAML SSO
    Given I am on the login page
    When I log in with "Single Sign-On (SAML)"
    And I decide to continue with a new account
    Then I am logged in into my account
    And I am on the dashboard page
    And Provider "SAML" is shown on my profile page
    And I receive a welcome email without a link to confirm my email address

  Scenario: Connect SAML SSO to existing account with matching email
    Given I am Lassie
    And I have an authorization
    And I am on the login page
    When I log in with "Single Sign-On (SAML)"
    Then I am logged in into my account
    And I am on the dashboard page
    And I see an account connection success notice
    And Provider "SAML" is shown on my profile page twice

  Scenario: Connect SAML SSO to existing account with matching email while being logged in

  Scenario: Connect SAML SSO to existing account with different e-mail address

    And I am logged in
    And I am on the profile page
    When I connect another "Single Sign-On (SAML)" account
    # This is the current behaviour which is probably unintended (see XI-5159)
