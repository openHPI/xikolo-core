### Experiments
#######################

# Persisted learning evaluation (PLE)
# This is currently an experimental feature, meant to replace calculations for
# progress, achievements and "learning evaluations". Disabled by default.
#
# - "write": a boolean that determines whether PLE will be calculated
# - "read": A boolean or integer.
#           When boolean, it determines whether PLE is actually *used* by the application.
#           When integer, this determines the percentage of requests that will be used for
#           comparing the old (dynamic) implementation to the new one, without actually
#           using the new one yet.
# - "legacy_courses": A list of course IDs where "fixed learning evaluations" remain
#                     (imported from an older course platform).
#
# For the use case in xi-web, a boolean value is sufficient.
# This is valid due to backwards compatibility.
